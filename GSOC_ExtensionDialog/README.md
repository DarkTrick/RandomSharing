HTML view of the mockup can be found here:

### What you see:
The website is a prototype for the search-for-extensions-dialog. It shows how the dialog would behave, if it was resizable.

### how to use:
- Resize your browser to see how the dialog would react to those changes.
- Enlarge/shrink your font-size within the browser (Ctrl++ / Ctrl+- / Ctrl+Scrollwheel) to see 
  how different font size would affect the design
